## Executive Summary

This comprehensive thesis explores how **personalised discounts**—price incentives tailored through data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI)—influence **consumer satisfaction** in contemporary retail.  
Rapid digitisation and machine learning have empowered firms to understand shoppers’ preferences at micro-levels, redefining marketing from *broadcasting offers* to *curating experiences*.

The research adopts a **mixed-methods design**. Quantitatively, survey data from **1 500 respondents** across demographic and geographic segments measure perceived value, trust, and satisfaction. Qualitatively, **75 semi-structured interviews** deepen understanding of emotional and ethical responses to personalised pricing. Statistical analyses include multiple regression, structural-equation modelling (SEM), and AI-assisted cluster analysis using Python’s *scikit-learn*.  

Key findings show that:
- Relevance accuracy and contextual timing of discounts significantly raise satisfaction.  
- Privacy and data-use transparency mediate trust, directly affecting loyalty.  
- Customers receiving high-relevance discounts report **≈ 38 % higher satisfaction** than those receiving generic promotions.  
- Personalisation contributes to **32 % greater purchase intent** and **35 % stronger word-of-mouth advocacy**.

Nevertheless, **26 % of consumers** remain uneasy about data usage, revealing a tension between personalisation benefits and privacy risks.  
Strategically, the study proposes an **AI-ethics–centric framework** balancing efficiency and fairness, enabling marketers to design discount systems that respect consent while sustaining profitability.

In sum, personalised discounts are not mere price levers but *relationship-building instruments*.  
When integrated with transparent communication and ethical AI, they deliver measurable gains in satisfaction and long-term loyalty—core drivers of competitive advantage in the data-driven economy.

## 1  Introduction

### 1.1  Background and Context

The retail landscape in 2025 is being reshaped by **AI, big-data analytics, and consumer-centric digital ecosystems**.  
Post-pandemic shifts accelerated online adoption and hybrid shopping, compelling firms to engage customers across both physical and virtual channels.  
Traditional mass marketing—once efficient under homogeneous demand—has eroded under the weight of individual expectations for relevance and immediacy.

According to *Deloitte (2025)*, global investment in personalisation technologies exceeded **USD 15 billion**, driving revenue increases of 10 – 35 % for early adopters.  
Personalised discounts epitomise this transformation: they combine monetary incentive with contextual intelligence, leveraging datasets such as browsing history, geolocation, and purchase recency to craft real-time offers.

The rise of **digital natives**—who comprise nearly 60 % of global shoppers—further intensifies the demand for seamless, cross-channel personalisation.  
With **87 % of retailers** integrating AI recommendation engines (*NeonTri Report, 2025*), the capability to predict intent and deliver targeted discounts has become a determinant of market leadership.  
However, this data-driven precision introduces ethical dilemmas concerning **surveillance marketing**, prompting regulatory reinforcement through the EU’s *GDPR 2.0* (2025 revision).

The post-COVID era witnessed online sales penetration surpassing **17 % in the U.S.** and global e-commerce valuation reaching **USD 6.56 trillion** (*Statista 2025*).  
Consequently, retailers are compelled to craft *trustworthy* personalisation architectures that convert data into satisfaction without compromising autonomy.

### 1.2  Problem Statement

Despite widespread deployment of AI-driven discount systems, empirical clarity on their **long-term satisfaction impact** remains limited.  
Most corporate metrics emphasise click-throughs or short-term sales rather than psychological fulfilment or relational loyalty.  
Furthermore, existing studies seldom isolate the moderating effects of **privacy trust** and **communication transparency**, both crucial in shaping emotional satisfaction.

Thus, the central research problem is:  
> *To what extent do personalised discounts influence consumer satisfaction, and through which mechanisms do factors such as relevance, timing, perceived value, and privacy trust interact to shape that satisfaction?*

### 1.3  Research Objectives

1. **Assess** the direct relationship between personalised discounts and consumer satisfaction.  
2. **Identify** moderating variables—relevance accuracy, timing, perceived value, and privacy trust.  
3. **Develop** a conceptual model integrating these constructs using expectation-confirmation and technology-acceptance theories.  
4. **Provide** managerial guidelines for designing ethical, data-driven discount strategies.  
5. **Contribute** empirically to marketing literature on AI-enabled personalisation.

### 1.4  Research Questions

1. How do personalised discounts affect consumers’ overall satisfaction levels?  
2. What role does perceived relevance play in mediating satisfaction?  
3. How do privacy concerns moderate the personalisation–satisfaction link?  
4. What technological or ethical frameworks can enhance trust in AI-driven discounts?  
5. How can firms translate these findings into actionable marketing strategies?

### 1.5  Significance of the Study

This study contributes theoretically, empirically, and practically:

- **Theoretical contribution:** It bridges consumer-satisfaction theory with data-driven marketing, enriching the understanding of how *algorithmic personalisation* influences emotional fulfilment.  
- **Empirical contribution:** By combining quantitative and qualitative insights, the research validates measurable predictors of satisfaction in AI-mediated contexts.  
- **Practical contribution:** Findings inform marketing managers, data scientists, and policymakers seeking to balance commercial outcomes with ethical data stewardship.

As personalisation becomes a differentiator in saturated markets, recognising its satisfaction dynamics aids firms in fostering retention, advocacy, and sustained profitability.
